# IAED-Project-2024
This is my project for my class of Introduction to Algorithms and Data Structures

This project's statement is here > enunciado.md

Some guidelines to how you should approach it [guidelines.md](guidelines.md), and some more usefull information here information.md (pretty much the same information as the last year's project).

There's 18 available tests of input in [public-tests](public-tests), so you can test your code (I don't have the 32 tests that were grading our project as of now - will update if they are ever available).

My project is [project.c](project.c), and it returns the expected output of all the 18 tests and the 31/32 private tests (couldn't get the last one because of the time limit, but outside that restriction it would accept).
